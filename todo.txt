make the agenda scroll through days and display dates
    make the agenda display "planning" instead of "agenda" (use the app to update the database in preparation for this change)
    make the flatlist-display day indicator component
    make one database planning document per day
    make the flatlist fetch for more contents when the end is reached and add the day displays to the array (just prepend it)
    add a day display bar at the top of the screen
    make the flatlist display time indicators: add them to the day indicator component and set the z index to be behind everything else

    memory usage: keep one array for "today" for the live planner, have another array for browsing through the agenda

    add break data types and break components

reliability (when used):

done

    X agenda time defining: this system can be changed completely to add handles or a switch, the goal is to allow scrolling through full agendas, make changing times easy, and make it intuitive for users
