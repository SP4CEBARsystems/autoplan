make the agenda scroll through days and display dates
    V make the agenda display "planning" instead of "agenda" (use the app to update the database in preparation for this change)
    V make the flatlist-display day indicator component
    v make the flatlist display time indicators: add them to the day indicator component and set the z index to be behind everything else
    V make the keys unique: either make a key generator or use indexes
    make one database planning document per day
    make the flatlist fetch for more contents when the end is reached and add the day displays to the array (just prepend it)
    add a day display bar at the top of the screen

    fix the time line spacing
    
    fix the z index problems with agenda events
    add z index as a property in the database
    fix z-index so that events can't be hidden behind generated planning elements
    set the Z-index to max for moving events so that they can pass other events
    reduce the width of elements so that underlaying elements can be selected (then their z-index will put them in front of everything)

    memory usage: keep one array for "today" for the live planner, have another array for browsing through the agenda

    add break data types and break components
    press enter to apply the typed numbers, or maybe not

planning algorithm
    add breaks
    look ahead

reliability (when used):
    lock the agenda page when it's loading (confirm if the to do page is still locked)
    find a function or package that can extract a valid float or int from a string

compatibillity
    test ios
    test android

settings
    break patterns

focus mode
    fix focus mode (it needs to properly point to it on all screen widths)
    add timers
    add a mini-viewer

todo page
    add a folding menu for extra parameters
    move the like parameter in there and add more parameters
    add tags types and categories to classify, and organize them, and to set break behavior rules 

production
    remove console logs
    update database rules

done 
    X conflicting touch events (resize conflicts with text select or scroll)
    X agenda time defining: this system can be changed completely to add handles or a switch, the goal is to allow scrolling through full agendas, make changing times easy, and make it intuitive for users
